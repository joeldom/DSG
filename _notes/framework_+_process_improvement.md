#Framework Implimentation + Process Improvement

The framework for Project Phoenix would be completley outside of this and is not hinged or required for these other process changes but the way live text, customization/personalization as well as other on-the-horizon updates to our code base would dramatically improive and be benefited by these process changes.

Along with the framework being implemented several educational phases would need address so that features and leadership ask's could be better understood from a technical capability and development standpoint.

##Campaign Alignment / Lab Team

*(Concept / Look-feel / Visual Execution)*

Initial phase of campaign category. This aims to solve for demographic centered markting executions that improve on LY's [^last-year] execution and aim to see what executions need updated.

* Campaign Deck 
* Shot Plan *(shots from coordinated on-location shoot)*
* Email Template concepting [^email-template1] (**Email Developer**)
	* This would be feature requests and template development [^feature-request1]

##Planning & Scheduling

Project is added to schedule based on Campaign and promo timing.

##Project Request

Product pricing and promotions are determined from scheduling with events and other printed material.

* Pricing
* Style numbers
* Schedule

##Project Alignment 

Meeting to schedule any special shots and determin any coordinated messaging with other events or promotions. Ecomerce landing pages and traffric throughput should have a 1:1 with proposed sections and links.

* Special shots (**Photo Coordinator & Digital Designer**)
* Messaging (**Copy Writer**)
	* main, secondary, Subject lines, CTA's, disclaimers
* Product Spot hierarchy
	* determin best ordering (head-to-toe or promo)
* Secondary inclusions
	* This would detail other functions such as personalization, find-store, or other campign alignments *(what used to be reffered as banners)*
* Ecom linking 
	* this helps determin CTA verbaige and if PDP or Categor pages are ready or need created. **UPDATED**
* Determining Template for category

##Creative R1

* Intial design phase (**Digital Designer**)
	* Typography
	* Shot retouching
	* product shots added
	* pricing verbaige
* Intial Proofread (**Copy Writer**) [^proofread1]
* Output build for preview **UPDATED**
	* FTP / ESP Directory creation [^litmus-esp1]
	* image folder added
	* grid layout 
* Post screencap / preview build for review **UPDATED**
	* This would be an update to the next phase as well as **PC**
	
##Planning / Merch / Photo R1

* Confrim promo / Pricing
	* run through channels (**Merchant + Planning**)
* Note changes
	* updates aligned to ecom page linking provided in alignment
	* image updates would include ADAM source links to insure accuracy (**Photo Coordinator**) **(UPDATED)**
* Post update for revisions **UPDATED**
	* This would be an update to the next phase as well as **PC**
	
	
##Creative R2

* Changes reviewed & implimented
* Proofread
* Proofs & live build updated
* Update posted for next phase as well as **PC** & **PM**


##Planning / Merch / Photo / QA FINAL

* Review of changes requested
	* Addtional changes this routes back to Creative FINAL for changes.
* QA of Live build updates with testing and sizing **UPDATED** [^quality-assurance1]
	* This could be after the build posts, but for more complicated it should be run through twice.
* Post update to proceed **UPDATED**
	* This would be an update to the next phase (**Digital Designer**) + **PC**		
	
##Creative FINAL

* Final output 
* Post update to procceed (**Digital Designer**)

* Post update to Release

##RELEASE

* Analyst sets time and confirms auto-blast

	



#####Dislaimer

---
Many of these steps and phases could be better fleshed out and have better declaration of single duties but this is primarily pulled from current working knowledge of the process.

These process suggestions address current hurdles within our production and would more closely adhere to production best-practices.



#####Footnotes
[^last-year]: previous execution with number of sales and ROI
[^email-template1]: This would be any variations or any customizations on current builds as well as dynamic or personalized section or other social integrations. **This would include testing.** Special grid layouts for non-standard sendings would be started here.
[^update1]: updates for next task phase currently only come out of creative but not into next task.
[^proofread1]: currently this is on the same level as design. This lets the phase be better planned in time and project location as well as the seperate noting of changes not originally accounted for.
[^custom-form1]: The form would include the standard allotment of product spots plus main messaging notes from alignment
[^litmus-esp1]: Currently there is ESP integration in **Litmus** that project build code as well as image hosting can all be added prior to analysts recieving the project task.
[^quality-assurance1]: QA would be best served as a seperate responsibiliy that would focus on linking and technical execution (browser & client testing outside of preliminary template testing) and less of proofreading but would be the final check that they all align.
[^feature-request1]: A feature request would be concepted during campaign lab team. This would then kick over into a seperate development timeline as it's own feature request to have tested and made during the early phases of a campaign or project.
