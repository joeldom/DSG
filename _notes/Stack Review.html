</ol></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="pointsnotcovered">Points Not Covered</h3>

<ul>
<li>Budget: this is something we&#8217;ve been kept in the dark about and as I am still contract after nearly 2 years it isn&#8217;t well understood, but we&#8217;ve been training employees and contractors outside of our team and across brands for over a year.</li>
<li>Risks (framework): the main risk with implementing a new framework or process is that ignorance and process habits are hard to break and pivoting to a new message approach is not intuitive.</li>
<li>Risks (process):</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>

<p>We aren&#8217;t being enabled to make the best work this company can make. With proper frameworks and development understanding we can incorporate the dev of new temaples into lab teams and have all of the testing done in the preliminary phases in the campaign and vet any concerns early on and come to a more solid and elegant apprioach to how to market instead of just promote.</p>

<p>We want to enable our team members and leadership with the understanding of what we are building to set the proper expectations so that they can have the proper input on what it is we can work to improve on. With seeing what can be built they would intern understand how to solve some of the process hicups we are seeing now.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve made these educational attempts to leadership and team members several times and keep getting tripped up when there is an inevitable change, which then looks like we don&#8217;t have a grasp on what it is we are talking about. We also get pushback from the CRM team when it comes to changes being properly implemented and in full. We have testing tools, but lack the time with content/planning dioctating when things should be worked in.</p>

<h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3>

<ol>
<li>Understanding of how more technical requests are handled</li>
<li>Input on how to adjust our process</li>
<li>Technology improvements either in use or on the horizion</li>
<li>Ways to colaborate on campaigns/designs/dev</li>
<li></li>
