#Stack Review

##Pain Points
###Process
1. Merchents & Planning deciding what goes into the emails instead of the products and promotions coming to us to write and develop a "story" and messaging for.
2. Shifting the focus off of top products or ones that have seen the email and ecom exposure being a copy & paste option for every sending we have.
3. CRM changing and modifying code outside of creating content objects and adding links is causing code segmentation making debugging impossible.
4. ESP features being requested on a per project schedule instead of as their own task to only be included once completly vetted (F&S flash sale timer held up 3-4 times because of this)

###Education / Interest
1. Team members & leadership not having the industry knowlwedge of what can be done with the top marketing trends that we have acces to build.
2. Team memebers not havinbg a solid understanding of front-end dev best-practices or languges like HTMl & HTML for email.
3. A proper QA phase that llooks for load times, file sizes, responisve interactions across deivces & clients.

###Current Process
1. Merchant spot bid
2. Product/Promo alignment
3. Email scheduled
4. Pre-alignment 
5. Alignment
6. MRF generated
7. MRF creative handoff
8. creative asset 

##Improvments

##### Current
? → ? → Concept/Lab → Planning → Design → ? → Production → Release

vs

Dev → Testing → Concept/Lab → Design → Production → QA 

or the **ideal**

Concept/Lab → Dev → Testing → Planning → Design/Prod :> QA → Sched/Queue → Release → Metrics/Analysis → Iterate → Repeat

###Tech
* Atom IDE: being able to push app settings to team members who aren't privey on going into the Mac system to adjust things themselves.
* Photoshop: asset libraries for reuable templates for catagories and assets.
* Sketch/Figma: desinging for multiple devices simulatnaeously.
* After Effects: having better animation apps to work with .gifs and editiing of videos.
* Github / Bitbucket (SourceTree): keeping templates, and colab files for a framework maintained.
* 

###Dev Cycle/Workflow
1. Having a set path for requests to follow
	2. Feature requests being alloted a timeframe for testing
3. Exposure to ways to better market ex. trigger emails, dynamic content, scene7 integration,
	4. Our ticker not working as it wasn't properly vetted to the designers and analysts with enough time to setup and test within the system as well as no support from the ESP for questions or features that would need setup on their end.


###Points Not Covered
* Budget: this is something we've been kept in the dark about and as I am still contract after nearly 2 years it isn't well understood, but we've been training employees and contractors outside of our team and across brands for over a year.
* Risks (framework): the main risk with implementing a new framework or process is that ignorance and process habits are hard to break and pivoting to a new message approach is not intuitive.
* Risks (process): 



###Thoughts
We aren't being enabled to make the best work this company can make. With proper frameworks and development understanding we can incorporate the dev of new temaples into lab teams and have all of the testing done in the preliminary phases in the campaign and vet any concerns early on and come to a more solid and elegant apprioach to how to market instead of just promote.

We want to enable our team members and leadership with the understanding of what we are building to set the proper expectations so that they can have the proper input on what it is we can work to improve on. With seeing what can be built they would intern understand how to solve some of the process hicups we are seeing now.

We've made these educational attempts to leadership and team members several times and keep getting tripped up when there is an inevitable change, which then looks like we don't have a grasp on what it is we are talking about. We also get pushback from the CRM team when it comes to changes being properly implemented and in full. We have testing tools, but lack the time with content/planning dioctating when things should be worked in.

###Takeaways
1. Understanding of how more technical requests are handled
2. Input on how to adjust our process
3. Technology improvements either in use or on the horizion
4. Ways to colaborate on campaigns/designs/dev
5.
